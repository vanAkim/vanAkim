### Hello, there 👋

## I'm currently a data scientist, a graduate engineer and my first love is physics.  
1️⃣ For now, I enjoy using R and Python, especially through Jupyter Notebook. I am always ecstatic when I discover a new functionality in the different packages of data manipulation (pandas, tidyr, data.table), dataviz (matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot), and regressions and machine learning (scikit-learn, caret, randomforest).

2️⃣ Less regularly, I touched a lot of other frameworks, such as the creation of maps (leaflet, folium, basemap), database management (MySQL, IBM DB), interactive solutions (plotly, shiny, googlevis, jupyter widgets), text analysis (quanteda, nltk).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my visibility
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash basics, git & Github
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't remember a day when I didn't laugh, even alone.
