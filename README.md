### Hello, there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a data scientist, a graduate engineer and my first love is physics. We have come a long way together and for now we have taken a little distance. But the end of one story is the start of another. Charmed by science and analysis, I discovered the world of ~~Narnia~~ data. It is a vast and moving world that I try to follow every day by learning and consolidating the knowledge that composes it.  

For now, I enjoy using R and Python, especially through Jupyter Notebook. I am always *~~feeling dumb~~* ecstatic when I discover a new functionality in the different packages of data manipulation (pandas, tidyr, data.table), dataviz (matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot), and regressions and machine learning (scikit-learn, caret, randomforest).

In a lighter and more specific way, I touched a lot of other frameworks, such as the creation of maps (leaflet, folium, basemap), database management (MySQL, IBM DB), interactive solutions (plotly, shiny, googlevis, jupyter widgets), text analysis (quanteda, nltk). I would like to improve my current skills on some of these solutions in addition to those described in the previous paragraph.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my visibility
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bash, Git & Github
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't remember a day when I didn't laugh, even alone.
